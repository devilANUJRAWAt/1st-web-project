          <p>DLF Foundation is committed to driving excellence along with inclusivity in education, helping shape the next generation of India. DLF Foundation’s flagship education Programme 'DLF CARES' was established with the premise that every child has the right to quality education and the primary objective is to nurture and handhold children to enable them to realize their true potential and become productive and responsible citizens of tomorrow. Under this Programme, we award scholarships to deserving students from low-income families and support their education in quality schools and institutions up to class XII and beyond. Since the inception of the program in 2011, close to 2000+ students from 19 states have been supported in their education and over 300 have gone on to pursue higher education. The scholars in addition to the academic interventions are also provided counselling and mentoring support through a dedicated Counselling cell established at the Foundation.</p>
          <p>In addition to academics, DLF Foundation also believes in nurturing the leaders of tomorrow in the field of sports. In line with this vision, the Foundation set up the Golf Excellence Program in partnership with DLF Golf Academy in 2017 to encourage the next generation of golf champions in India. Over the last 4 years, the Golf Excellence Program has worked with 19 promising youngsters who have won over 50 awards for first place at various regional and national golf championships in the country.</p>
